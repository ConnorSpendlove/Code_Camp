                MoodBuddy is a Tamagotchi-style digital pet that cares about one
                thing: <strong>your well-being</strong>. The happier you feel, the
                happier your buddy gets.

            <h2>Why we built this</h2>
            <p>
              We know how easy it is to ignore our own needs when we’re
              studying, coding, or scrolling. MoodBuddy turns basic
              self-care—like drinking water, stretching, or taking a walk—into
              a simple game where your pet mirrors your well-being.

          MoodBuddy was hacked together in a single caffeine-powered sprint by a
          small team of students who care about mental well-being, UX, and
          playful design.

        <h2>MoodBuddy is not a therapist</h2>
        <p>
          MoodBuddy is a playful way to nudge you toward small healthy habits,
          but it is <strong>not</strong> a replacement for professional help.
          If you’re struggling with your mental health, please reach out to a
          trusted person, counselor, or mental health professional in your area.
