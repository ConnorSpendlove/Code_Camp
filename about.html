      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>MochiFox was created to help you prioritize your mental health through small, manageable daily tasks. We believe that self-care doesn't have to be overwhelming—sometimes the smallest actions can make the biggest difference. By tracking your mood and completing simple tasks, you're not just caring for a virtual pet; you're caring for yourself.</p>
